We can define n! as n*(n-1)*(n-2)...*2*1. Last year, we wrote a function (fact n) in scheme that calculated n! using recusion.

 * Write a Jave method **public int fact(int n)** that will calculate and return n factorial using recursion. Put this in a class named Loops in a file Loops.java.

We can also use a looping structure, the **while** loop in Java. It's very similar to the **while** loop in Python.

    while (BOOLEAN EXPRESSION)
       // simple statement;

or 

    while (BOOLEAN EXPRESSION) {
        // multiple
        // statements
    }

which is similar to Pythons:

    while BOOLEAN EXPRESSION:
         s1
         s2
         .
         .
         .
         sn


 * Write another method **public int fact2(int n)** that, this time, uses no recursion, but rather a while loop to calculate n!.
