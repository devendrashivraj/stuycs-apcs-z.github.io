We're going to try to do the GitHub from home thing again.

**Please remember to follow directions exactly and pay attention to what you are doing and what the responses are**

**If you get into a weird situation such as GitHub telling you that proceeding will delete a bunch of files, don't do whatever you're doing**

**When asking for help, provide complete details of what you've done (cut and paste the sequence you typed, what exact tools are you using, screen shots)**

After installing git on your home machine and adding an ssh key, remove any old cloned repository. **Don't do this with git, just drag the folder to the trash.**

Clone the following repositories (use the ssh link for hw, either for classcode):

 * git@github.com:stuycs-apcs-z/hw.git
 * https://github.com/stuycs-apcs-z/classcode.git

Make sure the homework for the previous day is up in your hw folder.

Now, navigate to your homework folder and in that folder make a new folder for this homework (3-git-part-2) and then **change into that folder**.

**finish the assignment we started in class in this folder, git add, commit, and push these files**

To review, you were to modify the greeter class so that:
 * It has an instance variable for happygreeting and sadgreeting (both String)
 * A constructor with no parameters that gives both reasonable values
 * A constructor that takes two strings, one for each greeting
 * setHappy and setSad methods that will set the respective Strings to their parameter values
 * a happyGreet and sadGreet method that works like greet except returns the happy or sad greeting (you can remove the greet method).

This sounds like alot but most of the routines are **very** similar to what we've already written so you're not actually writing a lot of extra code.

Remember: 

 * Write one method at a time
 * Test it before you move on
 * Use the mail list for help

Remember, sometimes it will say you have to do another **git pull** before you can push (if other people pushed while you were working).

## Also

Please make sure to ssh to a stuy machine tonight and do a git pull in
the hw and classwork directories since we'll be working on them at
Stuy on Thursday.
