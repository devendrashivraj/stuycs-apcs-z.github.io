We're going to try to do the GitHub from home thing again.

**Please remember to follow directions exactly and pay attention to what you are doing and what the responses are**

**If you get into a weird situation such as GitHub telling you that proceeding will delete a bunch of files, don't do whatever you're doing**

**When asking for help, provide complete details of what you've done (cut and paste the sequence you typed, what exact tools are you using, screen shots)**

After installing git on your home machine and adding an ssh key, remove any old cloned repository. **Don't do this with git, just drag the folder to the trash.**

Clone the following repositories (use the ssh link for hw, either for classcode):

 * git@github.com:stuycs-apcs-z/hw.git
 * https://github.com/stuycs-apcs-z/classcode.git

Make sure the homework for the previous day is up in your hw folder.

Now, navigate to your homework folder and in that folder make a new folder for this homework (3-git-part-2) and then **change into that folder**
