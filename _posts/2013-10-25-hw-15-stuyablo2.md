Please use the mailing list this weekend to discuss the design of your groups piece of Stuyablo. Since the discussion will be on line, feel free to cross over groups.

On Monday, we'll spend the first 10 minutes of class in groups
finalizing proposed designs and then each group will present to the
class. From there, we'll make a formal specification for Stuyablo II
V0.1 and start writing it.


Remember, if you're designing a Character type class (player or non
player) you should decide on variables and methods and for each
method, what it takes, what it does, and what it returns (that is, how
things like combat should work).

You should not actually write code beyond the method signatures.

Also, remember to keep it basic (simple) we're just writing part 1 right now.

Please direct any questions to the list.
