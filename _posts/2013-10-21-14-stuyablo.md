First, go to coding bat and do these problems:

 1. [http://codingbat.com/prob/p194491](http://codingbat.com/prob/p194491)
 2. [http://codingbat.com/prob/p131516](http://codingbat.com/prob/p131516)

Remember you can test on the coding bat site.

Second, continue to develop your class ideas for Stuyablo.
