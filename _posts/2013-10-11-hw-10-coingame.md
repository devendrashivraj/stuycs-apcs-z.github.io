Grab the Coin and BankAccount classes from the coingame repository in classcode.

Create a class CoinGame in CoinGame.java

The CoinGame class will play a game between two players, each represented by a BankAccount. The CoinGame class should also have two instance variables represneting two Coins.

Each turn works as follows:

 1. Create the "pot" by withdrawing a random amount from both bank accouns and storing it in the game class.
 1. The coins should be flipped
 2. If it's two heads, player 1 (BankAccount 1) wins and gets the pot.
 3. If it's two tails, player 2 (BankAccount 2) wins and gets the pot.
 4. Otherwise, the money stays in the pot.

You will need the following instance variables in CoinGame:

 * Two BankAccounts
 * Two Coins
 * The pot
 * Anything else you need

Write a method **public void turn()** which plays out a single turn as described above.

You will also need methods to get the current BankAccount values so you can see who is winning.

Now write a method **public void play(int n)** which will play the game for n turns.
