title: Homework 1 - Setting up git
---

Due 9/24.

I'm asking for the first person to get the whole github thing working
on mac and windows to please send an email to the mailing list
sumarizing the steps. Also, please share any pointers, web sites, etc
and if you have problems, ask for help.

 1. Install git on your machine
 2. Clone the homework repository
 3. Find your homework folder.
 4. Add a folder for this homework, name it 1-first-homework (put anything in it you want).
 5. **git add 1-first-homework**
 6. **git commit -a -m "first hw test"**
 7. **git push**
 8. **git pull** (to make sure you have everything up to date)
 9. Edit the file, re-commit it and push again.

Note: You might have to do a **git pull** before you push your stuff
to sync if other people are pushing and pulling at the same time.
