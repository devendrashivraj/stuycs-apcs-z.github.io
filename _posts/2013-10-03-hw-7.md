#### Make the following modifications to the Coin class

 * Add an instance variable representing the value of the coin (for example 25 cents, 5 cents etc) as well as the name of the coin (quarter, nickel, etc.).
 * Make a constructor so that you can create a coin of a specific type (name) and value. You can pass both the name and value, or just pass one and hard code the other in your constructor with if statements.

#### Make a class CoinPurse

A CoinPurse should have the following instance variables:

 * amount -- the total value of all coins in the purse

A CoinPurse should have the following methods
 
 * addTo(Coin c) -- this adds a coin to the purse by adding its value to the purse
 * removeFrom(Coin c) -- removes the value of the coin from the purse.

You will also need constructors and possibly some other methods.
