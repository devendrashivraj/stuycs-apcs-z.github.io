Copy over the Radix sort stuff into this homework folder.

Add a routine **bsort(int[] a)** as we specified in class. When you are running it:

 * Count the number of comparisons the sort makes
 * Count the number of swaps
 * Time the routine on data larger and larger data sets until it becomes too slow.
 * Compare the speed to the radix sort


Then, try to optimize the sort, that is, make it faster.
