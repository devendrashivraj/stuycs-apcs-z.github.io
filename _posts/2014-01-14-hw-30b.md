Just add these to homework 30.

 * implement insertion sort as described in class
 * implement selection sort as described in class.

For the first part of the assignment, you were counting comparisons
and swaps. You should still count comparisons, but since the insertion
sort doesn't use swaps, you should count assigments. That is, each
swap is 3 assignments and each iteration of the inner loop of an
insertion sort should be 2 + the number of shifts.

You want to compare the three N^2 sorts in terms of:
 * actual clock time (as we've done in clsas before)
 * number of comparisons
 * number of swaps

also compare these to the Radix sort, at least for clock time.

Here's a link to some great visualizations of the sorts: [http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/ComparisonSort.html](http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/ComparisonSort.html).

It's part of [this](http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html) site which has visualizations of most of the stuff we'll be covering this year.
