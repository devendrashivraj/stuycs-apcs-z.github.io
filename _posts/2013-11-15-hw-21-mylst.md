#### Evaluating the Codingbat quiz you took home

For each problem, type it into codingbat (the name of the codingbat
problem is the same as the method name on the question. All three questions are from the Array sections on codingbat). 

You can make minor adjustments to the code to get it to work. For
example, if the paper forgot a ; or didn't declare a variable but used
it. Just don't rewrite the program - minor corrections only (but
remember, you're on their side).

Run the problems and record the number correct over the number of test
cases. For example, if there were 10 test cases and it ran correctly
on 7, record 7/10 on the paper.

I'd also encourage you to write comments if something was interesting
or well done and also if you have suggestions for improvement or
pointing out where there's an error.

#### myList

    public void insert(int pos, int d) {
     // inserts data item d at location pos in the data array
     // remember we have to shift down items to make room and
     // we might have to grow the array
    }

    public int remove(int pos) {
     // removes the data item at location pos from the array data
     // remember we have to shift down items.
     // return the removed data item
    }


Some classes started **insert** in class on Thursday but I think one started **remove**. Finish whichever one you started.
