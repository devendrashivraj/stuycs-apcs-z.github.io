In class today we discussed comparing the frequency counts of the
letters of our encoded string with the frequency counts in English.

To do this, we have to determine the frequency counts for english.

To do this, first go to [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/)
and download the plain text of some book. I downloaded
[The Complete Works of William Shakespeare](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/100). Make
sure to download t he
[Plain Text version](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/100.txt.utf-8).

Once you save the file, you can use a scanner to go over it character by character and do something with it:


      try {
            Scanner sc = new Scanner (new File(filename));
            while (sc.hasNext()) {
                String s = sc.nextLine();
                // do something to the line if you ened to
                for (int i=0;i<s.length();i++) {
                  char c = s.charAt(i);
                  // do something with each character
                }
            } catch (Exception e) {}


Given the instance variable declaration in the Ciphe class:

    private double[] CorpusFreqs;

Write a method:

    private void buildCorpusFreq(String filename)

which will open the file (based on the filename parameter) and read it
line by line (using the technique above to fill the *CorpusFreqs*
array. The routine should convert each line to lower case and then
only process letters. Disregard any other symbol).

When the routine is done CorpusFreq[0] will hold the frequecy of the
letter 'a' CorpusFreq[1] will hold the frequency of the letter 'b'
etc. The frequency is the number of times the letter appears over the
total number of letters in the corpus.
