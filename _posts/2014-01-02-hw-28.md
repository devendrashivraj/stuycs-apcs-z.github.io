For tonight write a Java class Cipher which currently has one method: *public String encode(Sting s, int offset)*

This routine should:

 1. Convert the string to lower case
 2. Make a new string that's the result of rotating each letter by *offset* characters. If you go past *z*, you should start counting again at *a*.
 3. Anything that isn't a letter should just be copied to the destination string as is.

For example, encode("hello",3) --> khoor and encode("abcxyz",3) --> defabc
