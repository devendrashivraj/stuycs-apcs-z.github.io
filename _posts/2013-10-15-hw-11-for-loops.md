Just create a class file named For.java for these.

 1. Rewrite at least one method you've already written using a for loop instead of a while loop.
 2. Write a method **public String Reverse(String s)** which will accept a String and return the String reversed - that is "Hello" would return "olleH" - to do this you must use a **for** loop and the **substring** method.
 3. Write a method **public String table(int n,int m)** which will create an NxM table of products. That is, table(5,3) will return a String representing the following Table:

>  1 2 3 4 5  
> 1 1 2 3 4 5  
> 2 2 4 6 8 10  
> 3 3 6 9 12 15
