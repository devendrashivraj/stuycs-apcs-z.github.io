Write a class **Coin** that will be used to track coin flips.

This class will be incomplete - we still have to discuss conditionals and random numbers tomorrow before you will be able to complete it.

For now:

You will need variables to hold:

 * The face (Heads or tails).
 * A way to track how many flips and how many heads / tails.
 * A number representing the fairness of the coin (what percent of the times comes up heads).


You will also need:

 * A method to reset the counts back to 0
 * A method to get the current face

Write the class so far and a driver to test. We'll develop it more in class tomorrow.

Remember to ssh to a stuy machine and do a git pull after you've pushed from home so that you'll have the code locally in class.
