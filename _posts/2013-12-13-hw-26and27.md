###Homework 26

Finish the wordsearch as we descibed in class. You should be able to:

 1. read a file of words into the wordlist ArrayList 
 2. create a puzzle by:
   1. selecting a random word from the wordlist
   2. Trying to add it to the puzzle (if it doesn't fit at first, try a few times then give up and try another word.
   3. If you can add the word to the puzzle add it to a "words" list that will contain all the words actually in the puzzle and remove it from the wordlist.
   4. Add how ever many words you think are appropriate.
 3. You should be able to print out:
   1. The puzzle with blanks (or dashes) for the non word spaces
   2. The complete puzzle with random letters filling in the spaces
   3. The list of words in the puzzle.

###Homework 27

In class, we set up myListIterator as an inner class of myList. If you were on the college trip make sure to check with a classmate for details. All the files are under interfaces2 in classcode.

 1. Finish the next routine -- The first time it's called it should return the 0th item in the array in the myList, then the second item, then the third, etc. If you try to go past the last item, the behaviour is undefined.
 2. Finishd he hasNext routine -- it will return true if there are more items to grab with next and false otherwise.
 3. Go to Driver and add a while loop to use your iterator to print out all the items in a myList.
