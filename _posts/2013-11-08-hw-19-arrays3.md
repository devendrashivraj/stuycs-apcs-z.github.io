For Tuesday:

add these routines to the ArrayStuff base we started in class (the one
where we wrote find and findMaxIndex, and the single constructor that
made an array of 20 random numbers - copy that from classcode).

 1. Write a routine **double  mean()** which will return the arithmetic mean (average) of the array. 
 2. Write a routine **double stddev()** which will calculate the standard deviation of the array.


You can read about standard deviation [here](http://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-deviation-formulas.html).
