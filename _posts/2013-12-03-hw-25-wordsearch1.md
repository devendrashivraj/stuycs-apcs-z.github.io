Grab the WordSearch starter code from the classcode repository on GitHub.

For tonight, write:

```
/*
Precondition: row, col represent the location to try to place the
	          first character of word

              word represents the word to try to place in the puzzle

Postcondition: If the word can be legally placed in the puzzle, modify
	           the board array so that the word is in the puzzle and
			   return True.
			   Otherwise, return false
	          
*/
public void addWordH(int row, int col, String word) {
}
```
