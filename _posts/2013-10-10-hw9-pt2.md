Complete the following methods (add them to homework 9)

 1. **public int gcd(int a, int b)** - this will find the greatest common divisor using the brute force method we discussed in class.
 2. **public int gcd2(int a, int b)** - this will return the gcd but this time using Euclid's algorithm, as discussed in class.
 3. Test gcd and gcd2 on a couple of large primes to see if there's a speed difference.
 4. Write **isPrime(int n)** which will return true if n represents a prime number and false otherwise.
