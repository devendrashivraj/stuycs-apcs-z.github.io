### Java Strings

Java Strings are classes and have methods similar to those you played with in Python:

    String s1="Hello World!";
    int a = s1.length(); // a will be set to 12
    System.out.println(s1.substring(6)); // Will print out "World!"
                                         // remember, we count from 0
    System.out.println(s1,substring(6,8)); // Will output "Wo"
    String s2 = s1.toUpperCase(); // s2 <-- "HELLO WORLD!"


You only need to know some of the Java methods for the AP Exam. You can find the AP reference [here](http://www.cs.duke.edu/csed/ap/subset/doc/ap/java/lang/String.html).

The full reference can be found [here](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html).

Take a look at the top of both documentation pages for more examples of working with Strings.

You are going to create a class StringStuff which will have the following methods:

 1. **String capitalize(String name)** -- this will accept a String representing a name (assume names are sent in all lower case, two names, first and last, with one space in between). The method will return a new String representing the name capitalized. So capitalize("mike zamansky") will return the String "Mike Zamansky".
 2. **String bondify(String name)** -- this will accept a String specifying a name (using the same assumptions as in the previous question) and will return a String in the form "last, first last" as James Bond might do. So, bondify("James Bond") would return "Bond, James Bond" and bondify("Mike Zamansky") would return "Zamansky, Mike Zamansky."

You will have to create new Strings and use a variety of methods to do this. In particular look to use:

 * indexOf
 * substring
 * toUppeCase
