### Part 1

You want to compare inserting at the beginning of an ArrayList with
adding to the end.

Use System.CurrentTimeMillis() as we did when we foudn the mode fo an array to
do this.

Create an ArrayList and then fill it using first a.add("x") then
a.add(0,"x") to add n elements to the ArrayList (with n increasing
until it gets crazy large or until you otice a difference between the
two adds.

Write down your results (they were the same no matter what, one
started to get slower at some point, the difference was large or
small, etc.).

### Part 2

Do a similar comparison of remove. See if there is a timing difference
when you remove from the front of a list or from the back.

Create a large list (using the faster add from part 1) and then time
removing all the elements down to empty using a remove from front then
remove from back.

Again, write down your results.

### Part 3

Create an ArrayList, fill it with some values, then write the code to reverse teh ArrayList. This is all about getting practice with ArrayList notation.

Write your solution in Driver.java and put in comments your results from part 1 and part 2.
