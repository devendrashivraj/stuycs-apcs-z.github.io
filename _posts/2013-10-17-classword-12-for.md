We'll only be going over these in class if you have questions so if you do, make sure to ask.

 1. Write a method **public String diag(int n)** which will return a diagonal string of stars that will appear to be a diagonal line when printed. For example, diag(4) would return:

 > *  
 >  *  
 >   *  
 >    *  

 2. Write a method **public String diagWord(String w)** which will return a string as above but using the letters of word **w** instead of using stars. For example, diagWord("Hello") would return:

 > H  
 >  e  
 >   l  
 >    l  
 >     o  

 3. Write a method **public String fence(int h, int w)** which will return a String representing a fence. For example, a 5 by 8 fence would look like this:

 > +------+  
 > |      |
 > |      |
 > |      |
 > +------+
