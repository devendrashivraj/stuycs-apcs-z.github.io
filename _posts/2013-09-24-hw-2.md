This homework will step you through connecting to school from home as well as using GitHub.

### Connecting to school

For this, you need an ssh client. 


##### For the Mac or Linux

 * You can just open up a terminal
 * type **ssh username@machinename** where machinename is the machine you want to connect to and username is the username you use to log into the computers in room 307.
 * Machines you can connect to: cslab1-1.stuy.edu, cslab1-2.stuy.edu up to cslab1-30.stuy.edu (although some might be down).
 * You will then be asked for a password.
 * Once you're logged in, it's just like you're in a terminal at Stuy. The only restriction is that you can't run graphical programs. If you type **emacs** it will load in terminal mode, but you can use javac, emacs, git, etc.

##### For Windows

 * Download [putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) - a windows based ssh client
 * Run it, open a connection to one of the machines listed in the Mac and Linux section. Make sure you've clicked the button for **ssh** connection and the port should be 22.
 * Specify your username as the username you use to log in in 307.
 * Once you're logged in, it's just like you're in a terminal at Stuy. The only restriction is that you can't run graphical programs. If you type **emacs** it will load in terminal mode, but you can use javac, emacs, git, etc.

##### Setting up ssh for git on the stuy machines.

 * open an ssh terminal to a stuy machine.
 * Open a web browser to github, log in, then go to the settings then SSH keys page.
 * Follow the **generate ssh-keys** guide (linked at the top of the page). Where it says to type something into the terminal, do it in the ssh window EXCEPT step 3. Instead, just type **cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub** and then copy it using the mouse.

##### Cloning to Stuy
 * ssh to stuy.
 * You can run git clone *repository* to clone the **hw** and **classcode** repositories to stuy.
 * Now, you can ssh in from home and do a **git pull* some time during the evening and your stuy account will always have the most up to date files.
