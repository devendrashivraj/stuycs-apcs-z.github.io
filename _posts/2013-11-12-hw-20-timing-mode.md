title: Homework 20 - timing mode (nothing to put on github
published: true
---


For tonight, update your copy of the classcode repository

Under each of your classes there is a folder array2 - copy that somewhere on your machine.

In it, you can see how we use System.currentTimeMillis() to get the
current time in milliseconds and then to figure out the elapsed time
of running our mode routine

Try running mode multiple times on arrays of size 10, 100, 1000, 1000 etc until it reliably starts to slow down.

Do the same test on finding the max instead of the mode.

Do they both behave the same way?

Think about what's going on and why. We'll discuss in class tomorrow.
